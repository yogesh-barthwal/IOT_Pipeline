# IoT Predictive Maintenance (Simulation)

This project demonstrates an end-to-end predictive maintenance pipeline 
using synthetic data. All datasets are generated internally via 
`src/collect_data.py` to simulate IoT sensors in a smart factory.

⚠️ Note: No real industrial data is used. This setup is intended for 
learning, prototyping, and testing purposes only.
